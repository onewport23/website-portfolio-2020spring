<h4>Collegiate Recovery a Focus at Pitt</h4>
<p>Collegiate Recovery Programs (CRP’s) have become increasingly prominent across college campuses in the United States over the past ten years.

<p>Many people are brought to service through personal challenges they’ve dealt with or witnessed firsthand.

Shortly after PMADD, Eric discovered the Service Leadership Committee (SLC). This is where he began his PittServes journey the following year. SLC is a subgroup of the Student Civic Engagement Council (SCEC) that plans and participates in monthly service projects and serves as the project leaders during Signature Days of Service. SCEC is a group of eight students that PittServes Assistant Director, Shenay Jeffrey often describes as the office’s “right hand.” Eric recalls his early experiences as a member of the committee, “It was awesome to just sign up and work somewhere with a bunch of different people and explore the city, because if I wasn’t involved with this I wouldn’t have an intention to go into these communities.” Once he took on the role of SLC Co-Head he began closely interacting with students on the SCEC, which led him to apply to serve on the Council and obtain the position that he holds today...
