My webpage preview is pretty bare-bones. I am still working through a mastery of the HTML and CSS concepts, so I have been slowly adding content to the webpage with each new concept. As I mentioned in the proposal, I want this webpage to serve as a one-stop link that I can provide to recruiters for all of my writing and design materials. This comes in the form of the page's content, but strategic styling can hopefully portray my personality as well. In terms of style, my preview's fonts and colors are a reflection of my playing with different color codes, and learning how to implement fonts. I do not intend to use these styles through my final draft. In regards to the content, so far I have inserted what I intend to be the different homepage tabs (bio, writing portfolio, and design portfolio). I also have a brief bio written for a body paragraph of the bio tab. 

Clearly, I still have a lot to do before my first draft: 
-insert profile image
-link tabs to homepage
-upload/link writing and design portfolios into their respective tabs
-determine personal grid layout
-determine flexbox layout
-select font
-select background colors
-choose background image and upload for top header
-create drop-down menu for design (and maybe) writing portfolio

Moving forward, I simply have to devote time to practing and understanding each concept to complete all of listed tasks.
