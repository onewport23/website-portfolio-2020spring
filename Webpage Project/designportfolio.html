 <h2 id='creativeconsult'>Creative Consulting Committee</h2>
<p>My Sophomore year, I served on the Executive Board of the Pitt American Marketing Association as the VP of Consulting. This required me to head the Creative Consulting Committee (CCC). Included on this page is the flyer that I designed to recruit members for CCC, as well as a banner that I designed for one of our clients, Panther Racing.

  <h2 id='eriehumane'>Erie Humane Society</h2>
     <p>During the summer of 2018 I interned with the Erie Humane Society as a Marketing Intern. Through this role, I was responsible for creating several graphics for various shelter events. The images that I included on this page are different social media advertisements for Clear the Shelters Day, Mutts at the Movies, and Yappy Hour. </p>

  <h2 id='wandd'>Integrating Writing and Design</h2>
           <p>This past semester as a part of my Digital Media Certificate, I took a course called Integrating Writing and Design. For my final "Self-Defined" project, I created an "Argentina Travel Guide" based off of my previous study abroad experience. The image below is the cover page of the guide, and links to a full PDF of the design. </p> </div>
